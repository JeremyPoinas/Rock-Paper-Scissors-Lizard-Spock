# How to play

**Player 1**

 1. Enter the ETH address of the player you want to challenge, the move you want to play, and the amount to bet that will be staked
 2. Commit your move
 3. You get redirected to a new page for your newly created game   
 WARNING!  
 - YOU WILL NEED TO COPY THE URL AND SEND IT TO PLAYER 2 SO HE CAN PLAY WITH YOU  
 - YOU WILL NEED TO REMEMBER THE SALT AND YOUR MOVE. WE KEEP THE SALT IN STATE ONLY IF YOU STAY ON THE PAGE  
 4. Here you can decide to declare a timeout for player 2 if he doesn't play after 2mn has passed since the creation of the game
 5. Once player 2 has played, you can solve the game by revealing the move you played and the salt (only written if you stayed in the page)
 6. Funds are sent to the winner

**Player 2**

 1. Player 1 must send you the URL of the game since it is a newly
    deployed smart contract
 2. Select the move you want to play (be sure to check the amount bet by player 1 as you will have to stake this amount)
 3. Wait for player 1 to solve the game. If he doesn't do it after 2mn, you can declare a timeout for player 1 and take the whole stake
 4. Once player 1 has solved the game, funds are sent to the winner

HAVE FUN!
